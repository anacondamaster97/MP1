Gossip Membership Protocol with Heartbeating
Overview
This project implements a Gossip Membership Protocol using heartbeating to manage membership in a distributed system. The protocol ensures that all nodes in the system are aware of each other’s presence by propagating membership information through a gossip mechanism. It's designed to handle node joins, failures, and departures in a scalable and fault-tolerant way.

Background
History of Gossip Protocols
Gossip protocols have been widely used in distributed systems due to their simplicity and robustness. First developed in the 1980s, gossip-based communication mimics the way information spreads in social networks. Every node in the system periodically selects a random peer to exchange information, ensuring the eventual dissemination of data.

Key features of gossip protocols include:

Scalability: Due to the decentralized nature, gossip protocols scale well with the number of nodes.
Fault tolerance: The failure of one or more nodes has minimal impact on the protocol's operation.
Simplicity: The protocol is straightforward to implement and understand.
Gossip protocols have been adapted for various distributed system tasks, such as membership management, failure detection, and data replication.

Protocol Design
Overview
In this implementation, each node maintains a list of other nodes in the system along with their statuses (alive, suspected, failed). Nodes send periodic heartbeats to a subset of other nodes to update them on their state. If no heartbeat is received from a node within a timeout period, the node is suspected of failure.

Components of the Protocol
JOINREQ (Join Request): When a new node attempts to join the system, it sends a JOINREQ message to an existing node. This message contains the joining node's ID and address.

JOINREP (Join Reply): Upon receiving a JOINREQ, an existing node replies with a JOINREP message that contains the current membership list, allowing the new node to integrate with the system.

Ping Mechanism: Each node periodically sends PING messages to a random subset of other nodes to ensure they are still alive. A PING includes the sender’s heartbeat counter.

Indirect Ping: If a direct PING does not receive a reply within a timeout period, the node sends an indirect ping by requesting another node to ping the unresponsive node on its behalf.

Heartbeat Counter: Each node maintains a heartbeat counter, which it increments at regular intervals and shares with other nodes in its PING messages.

Gossip: Membership changes (e.g., node failures or new joins) are gossiped between nodes through periodic exchanges of membership lists.
